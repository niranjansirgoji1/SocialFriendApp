# Social Friend User App 

Social Friend User App is a  C++ application that simulates a simplified social networking system. Users can register, log in, add friends, view mutual connections, and even send pair-up (relationship) requests. The app models users as nodes in a graph and utilizes core algorithms like BFS for friend suggestions and shortest connection paths. With features like friend dashboards, activation controls, and persistent file storage, it showcases a real-world application of data structures and algorithms in C++.

## App Features

### User Features
- **Creating user accounts/login**: Users can create new accounts and login if they have an existing account

- **Remove pair connection**:Users can remove their current pair connection and then can pair up with someother

### Other Top Features

- **Celebrity Dashboard**:Users can view the top most users of the app with most friends/connections

- **Degree of Connection**:The top most feature of this app where user can check how closely they are connected to an user.

## Concepts used

### Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Graphs and Graphs algorithms**:Users and their connections are stored using graphs and graph algorithms like bfs are used for "Degree of connection","Suggestions","Mutuals"etc.

- **Vectors,maps**:Hash map is used to keep track of the userids etc.

- **Queues,Priority Queue**: Priority queue used for celebrity dashboard rankings

- **OOPS**:A Class named User is defined to store the data of the users 

- **File I/O**:file i/o concepts are used to store the user data.
